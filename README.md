## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a technical architect and software developer who has always been fascinated by automation. My love for programming started at age 5, writing toy programs in BASIC (dating myself here). Since then, I've honed my skills and have been developing custom solutions for clients across various industries, from healthcare to finance, having helped organizations streamline their operations and achieve significant cost savings. 

As a freelancer, I've had the opportunity to build solutions with languages like COBOL, C, C++, Perl, PHP, Python, R, Java, C#, Python, Swift, and Dart with Flutter apart from Javascript/Typescript, HTML, CSS and React for the Web world. I mostly work with Amazon Web Services for the backend. For a laudry list of my experience you can visit my LinkedIn page.

In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with new technologies and experimenting with different automation tools. My current interest is in Machine learning applications, while also dabbling with Rust and WebAssembly. I'm an active member of the developer community and enjoy sharing my knowledge and expertise with others.
